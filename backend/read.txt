with the models to perform actions such as retrieving data, manipulating it, and sending responses back to the client. 

3. Routes: Routes define the API endpoints that clients can access to interact with your application. They map incoming requests to the 
appropriate controller methods based on the requested route and HTTP method.

your application. These can include functions for data validation, authentication, authorization, error handling, or any other common
